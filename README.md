VoziMe! Is a project dealing with taxies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, primarily Sarajevo,
which are very expensive, and sometimes hard to get a hold of. People often have to
call an actual service provider to get information on available vehicles. We came up with
a system similar to the popular Uber, but we still have to conform to Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s law. VoziMe! Is an idea of an application whose primary audience would
be young people who use smartphones in their everyday lives, as well as all those who
can navigate through a simple application. The goal is to make taxis as accessible as
possible, so that we do not have to call several phone numbers to get a vehicle to pick
us up. Although there is already a similar application on the market, its review score of
3.5 stars, as well as some comments, witness that the app’s design and implementation
are simply not good enough to satisfy the needs of the current market. To be better than
competition, our solution would have to be all-around, taking into consideration the
current business model of Sarajevo’s taxi companies, as well as public transports, and
offering them an automated, user-run system.
What our application offers to its users:
- Ordering taxi vehicles in an easier way
- Getting information, reviews and comments on other users
- Ability to refuse dispatched taxi driver and request another one
- Approximate price for the start and end location entered
What our application could offer to a taxi company wishing to implement it:
- Detailed insight in drivers and drive history
- Reaching a wider group of users
- Statistics on the most profitable tours, destinations, locations, and times of day
- Easier driver-passenger communication
